Tests which fail or don't work correctly:
bigtest - Relay on reusing glut menu id, so "gfx modes" item doesn't work
joytest - GtkGLUT don't have any support for joystick device
overtest - GtkGLUT don't have support for overlays.
test5  - GtkGLUT lack support of color indexed mode.
test7 -  Behaviour may be somthing different than original GLUT, but mostly OK.
test9  - GtkGLUT lack support of color indexed mode.
test17 - GtkGLUT don't have support for overlays.
test18 - GtkGLUT don't have support for overlays and all window operations are
         executed immediately (no caching of hide/show/fullscreen/...).
test19 - GtkGLUT relays on GTK+ which (may) send expose more times, than original glut do.
         So display may be called more times than in original GLUT.
test21 - Video resizing is not supported by GtkGLUT.
test22 - GtkGLUT relays on GTK+ which (may) send expose more times, than original glut do.
         This test is little misterious, because it fails in original GLUT too and GtkGLUT
	 can do more stages of test, than original GLUT can do.
test23 - Works, but glutInitDisplayString is really not fully supported.
test25 - Font proportions are little different than in original GLUT.
