What you need
=============
- GNU variant of make
- gcc
- GTK+
- GtkGLExt
- pkg-config
- doxygen (only for documentation, not really needed)

Basic Installation
==================

There is no configure script, but don't be confused, Makefile is rather
inteligent and use pkg-config for system differencies.

If you run make, static and dynamic version of library is builded.

With parameter "all", test programs are builded and staticaly linked too.

You may set parameter PREFIX and DESTDIR with same meanings as in
autotools generated makefiles.

With parameter "install" base libraries are installed. If you want
install documentation, please use "install-doc" (you need doxygen).

If you want original GLUT compatibility library, please use
make install-compat.

THE HOPE
========
	
Hope you find my work somehow useful.
