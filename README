    BRIEF OVERVIEW
    ==============

    This is the GtkGLUT package.
    
    GtkGLUT, the GTK+ openGL Utility Toolkit, is meant to be a free alter-
    native to Mark Kilgard's GLUT library. It is distributed under an X-Consor-
    tium style license (see COPYING for details), to offer you a chance to use 
    and/or modify the source.
    
    It makes use of OpenGL, GLU, GTK+ and GtkGLExt libraries. The library does
    not make use of any GLUT code and is not 100% compatible. Code recompilation
    and/or slight modifications might be required for your applications to work
    with GtkGLUT.
    
    Some code is based on freeglut and OpenGLUT packages (see COPYING for 
    details). Documentation is slighty modified OpenGLUT in-source
    documentation, generated by Doxygen.

    PORTS

    Win32 port isn't well tested and it's mostly alpha version.
